Here we will develope informational system for Kerch State Maritime Technological Univercity. It will be used as a kiosk terminal in entrance hall. It should represent schedule, local news, calendar, photos, which are specific for our high school and should be accessible to cadets and visitors. This project is mostly carried out by students, so we need to provide low cost solution, easy to setup and use.
